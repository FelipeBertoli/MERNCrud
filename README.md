# Mern Crud
This application consists in a simple crud of book writers, using the concept of MERN, that stands for MongoDB, Express, React and Node.

## Tools
* __MongoDB__: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores the book writers' data in a flexible, JSON-like format, allowing efficient and scalable storage and retrieval of information.
* __Express__: Express is a web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications, handling HTTP requests and routes in the MERN CRUD application.
* __React__: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling the creation of interactive and dynamic UI components for seamless user experience in the MERN CRUD application.
* __Node.js__: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, enabling the backend functionality to handle requests, interact with the database, and manage the application logic.
* __Manifest__: The manifest is a CSS framework that contains metadata about the web application, allowing it to be installed on users' devices, enhancing the user experience by providing features like offline access and installation to the home screen.
